# Statistics-and-Trends
My code project is giving details GDP GROWTH  analysis 
Classified into IncomeGroups.Regions & Designated TableName to know the percentage GDP SHARE
MODULES for analysis Seaborn for heatmap, numpy,pandas and matplotlib for plotting and reading files
I used vizualization methods(Pie chart ,Bar charts and Heatmap ) to diagrammatically represent data.
Pie chart to Represent Income Group  data in percentage(%)
Bar chart to represent Region Data (Values of gdp yield)
Heatmap for all data correlation
